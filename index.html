        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I began my journey in engineering with two years of a Bachelor's of
          Engineering (Aeronautical) at the University of Sydney immediately
          after leaving Year 12. This proved to be a poor decision as it was
          clearly not the field I was truly passionate for. At the end of my
          second year I decided on a change and found an Apprentice
          Civil/Structural Draftsman position available at Lindsay Dynan. This
          was the moment of realisation that this was the industry I wanted to
          spend my life in. Upon completing my apprenticeship, and undertaking a
          season of cricket in the UK, I returned with the determination to get
          a Degree in Civil Engineering. <br /><br />
          Combining my studies in engineering with business has opened up a new
          world of possibilities for me. I now see and understand the financial
          side of engineering and how it fits into the national and
          international economic landscape. My studies in innovation have also
          led me to pursue Android App development (Java) and inclusion in the
          Slingshot Pre-Accelerator Startup Program. <br /><br />
          I'm a huge supporter of embracing new technologies such as BIM, AR and
          AI and I firmly believe these will have a massive influence on our
          industry in the next 10 years. For young engineers this means having
          the skills necessary to succeed in a rapidly changing world, whether
          they be in programming, visualisation or management of international
          sub consultants. <br /><br />
          During my time at University I have also run a Kickstarter campaign
          (unsuccessfully) for the worlds smallest portable phone charger;
          created and was Vice President of the Newcastle University Fraternity
          and I've created a Facebook page with around 3000 followers that
          notifies students of free food around campus. <br /><br />
          Most recently I have been creating AR and VR applications for Android
          and iOS to help people sell easier. Whether it's houses, food, clothes
          or cars, VR and AR are a way to help people make more sales.
