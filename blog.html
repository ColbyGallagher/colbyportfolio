        <h1>A day wearing augmented reality smart glasses</h1>
        <p>Written Feb 23, 2018</p>
        <img src="resources/adaywearingaug/glasses1.jpeg" alt="arglasses" />
        <p class="big">
          This article takes place in a future world where augmented reality
          (AR) smart glasses have replaced smartphones completely. I.e. only
          grandma still uses an old iPhone while everyone now uses smart
          glasses. This is still a number of years away, but many large
          mainstream companies like Apple and Google are working on augmented
          reality glasses, while there also are many smaller startups looking to
          force their way into the industry. AR smart glasses have the potential
          to impact our world similar to how the smartphone did, as backed up
          here by Apple CEO Tim Cook. The key benefit of smart glasses is that
          there will no longer be a need for display devices, creating freedom
          for your hands to interact with the world. TV’s, computer monitors,
          information boards, menus at restaurants, billboards playing generic
          ads will all be replaced by smart glasses. This article will step
          through a persons daily life and how it will be impacted by AR smart
          glasses.
        </p>
        <h2>The morning</h2>
        <img src="resources/adaywearingaug/screens1.jpeg" alt="arglasses" />
        <p class="big">
          You wake up in the morning and put on your smart glasses as you walk
          to the kitchen for breakfast. Automatically, your glasses fire up with
          whatever you want to see first in the morning. Perhaps the news and
          highlights from the overnight EPL games, the Daily Telegraph, your
          Facebook news feed or your email inbox. These will appear
          semi-transparent in the left of your field of vision to allow you to
          still interact with the world around you. You are reading through the
          news as you use two hands to butter your toast and pour your coffee.
          You are scrolling through Facebook while you are making your sandwich
          for lunch.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your loungeroom will also look a bit a different. There is no big
          black TV dominating the loungeroom, because you don’t need a TV
          anymore. You can sit down on the lounge and watch a movie on a 200
          inch virtual screen that you can place wherever you want. You sit down
          on the lounge with your daughter who’s watching something on a virtual
          screen in her augmented reality glasses. You use your parental
          controls to see that she’s watching cartoons, and then flick on the
          Morning Show while you drink your coffee. Two people sitting next to
          each other watching their own show, listening via their bone
          conducting glasses. <br />
          <br />Traditionally if someone wants to watch a movie that nobody else
          does they need to go to another room or get a laptop and some
          headphones which isolates them from the people in the room. AR glasses
          mean everyone can be sitting in one room watching what they want on
          the big screen. <br />
          <br />Sports viewing could change overnight with the installation of
          360-degree cameras in stadiums and on players. A person could be able
          to get into the atmosphere of a game by sitting with the crowd on the
          sideline, or really get into the players head by watching from a
          helmet mounted camera; all while sitting in their living room.<br />
          <br />
          As you walk past your study, your ‘computer’ that you work on looks a
          bit different because there’s no monitors; just a keyboard and mouse.
          Why have physical monitors when you can create twelve virtual screens
          within your AR glasses in the touch of a button?
        </p>
        <h2>The commute</h2>
        <img src="resources/adaywearingaug/driving.jpeg" alt="arglasses" />
        <p class="big">
          Now you’re ready to go, you hop into your car to drive to work. The
          glasses automatically recognise your car and loads up your heads up
          display, showing the ‘best’ directions to work that day, fuel level,
          speed and traffic warnings from the government. I say the ‘best’
          directions, because in a world where everyone is wearing AR smart
          glasses, traffic data can be utilised in real time in order to provide
          navigation that takes into account traffic. Waze is doing something
          similar to this but without that extra layer of traffic data input its
          purely just an estimate. <br />
          <br />Or perhaps you’ve chosen to get a self-driving car, catch the
          bus or train. No longer are you limited to looking at your little
          phone screen for an hour. You could pop out a keyboard, get some
          virtual monitors into your field of view and start the days work, no
          longer limited by the size of a laptop screen. Or maybe you’d rather
          watch a movie or TV series on a 50-inch screen.
        </p>
        <h2>The workday</h2>
        <img src="resources/adaywearingaug/glasses2.jpeg" alt="arglasses" />
        <p class="big">
          You arrive at work and see that quiet guy from the digital marketing
          department who’s name you can never remember. But since you’re wearing
          smart glasses, facial recognition kicks in as he walks closer and a
          name tag appears above his head, plus a few notes about him that have
          been collected in your very brief conversations around the water
          cooler. You ask him how he went at his soccer competition that he
          mentioned, in passing, a month ago. This may sound creepy but you can
          modify your privacy settings as you please, allowing people to store
          only certain data about you, or none at all. Within an office scenario
          you can set up your virtual monitors with privacy settings according
          to what you’re working on. If you and your boss constantly look at
          each other screens to discuss ideas, you can set them as always having
          access to see your screen, but since your team is working on a
          classified government defence project, your screens are invisible to
          everyone else in the office. AR smart glasses will offer the biggest
          change for people that work in site roles. Traditionally the only link
          these people have to technology is via their smartphone. But in order
          to use their smartphone they need to put down their tools, pull their
          phone out of their pocket and find the information, then put the phone
          away and get back to work. Smart glasses can provide this information
          permanently in the corner of the persons vision and can provide
          feedback based on what the glasses are seeing. For example, a person
          may be installing reinforcement for a concrete slab for a new
          building. The glasses know the building plans (the latest model is
          always provided to employees), the stage of construction (from the
          project manager) and that the persons job is to lay reinforcement. The
          glasses notice that the bars being laid are tagged as 16mm diameter
          bars instead of the required 20mm diameter bars and alerts the person.
          The person checks this alert and it was right, saving the time of
          laying the wrong size reinforcement, pulling it all out and laying the
          correct reinforcement.
        </p>
        <h2>The lunchbreak</h2>
        <img src="resources/adaywearingaug/lunchbreak.jpeg" alt="arglasses" />
        <p class="big">
          It’s your lunch break at work so you head down to the food court to
          buy something. The traditional menu boards behind the counter now show
          you personalised recommendations based on what you’ve ordered in the
          past or your preferences. For example, a vegetarian person lining up
          at McDonalds won’t see the traditional advertisements for a Big Mac
          when they look at the menu, they will only see tofu burgers and
          salads. The left-hand side of the menu board may show recently ordered
          items, while the next section recommends items you may like based on
          your previously ordered items. The next section can provide
          personalised offers and specials from the company. Businesses can
          target each person individually, thus fulfilling their needs better
          and creating an offering that is tailored to the persons needs and
          preferences. Physical shopping will become more like online shopping
          where users are tracked as they move around a website and allow
          businesses to see where they’re losing customers. Brick and mortar
          restaurants can now do something similar by seeing what items people
          are looking at and then what they decide to purchase, or not purchase.
          Based on this data they can then tailor the offering to each segment
          of customer. As you leave the shopping centre after lunch and walk out
          onto the street you look up the billboard across the road. Your
          glasses know that occasionally after lunch you grab a smoothie on the
          way back to work, so the billboard shows you a customised
          advertisement for a special $2 smoothie at the café at the base of
          your office building. The random person walking next to you has just
          left the gym, so the billboard shows them an advertisement for a
          protein shake from the take away shop on their walk home. The next
          person is on holiday and sees a special deal on a dolphin watching
          cruise. The options are endless. Traditional advertising that
          currently costs businesses thousands can be tailored in the way that
          Google tailors online advertising based on your web browsing history
          (among other things) and allows the success/failure of these ads to be
          tracked and measured. No longer is a business guessing how successful
          their $10,000 billboard advertisement was, because they have data
          showing how many people looked at their ad, and how many acted upon
          it. A world where people can put virtual objects anywhere will
          obviously get confusing, thus the ability to set your filters to only
          see what you want to see will be critical. Businesses may choose to
          make some extra money by covering their walls in advertisements for
          other businesses, similar to what websites do with banner ads.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <img src="resources/adaywearingaug/glasses3.png" alt="arglasses" />
        <p class="big">
          It will be many years before we can get a form factor like the one
          seen. There are many challenges which need to be overcome before this
          vision becomes a reality. Portable computing power technology needs to
          increase to the point where the equivalent of GTX 1070 graphics card
          can fit inside the standard form factor of glasses. Battery life will
          need to increase while reducing in size. Perhaps wireless charging
          will increase in range to the point where our glasses are constantly
          powered by a power bank in our pocket (http://www.wi-charge.com/), or
          maybe public wireless charging infrastructure will allow our glasses
          to be constantly charged. Sensor accuracy will also have to increase.
          In order for AR to work in the real world, the exact location of the
          glasses relative to objects needs to be known down to millimetre
          accuracy. If the augmented reality overlay on the world doesn’t quite
          fit in with the menu of the restaurant its going to break the
          illusion. At the moment GPS is only accurate to about 3–5 metres, but
          this is changing quickly with new technology set to be released soon
          which will increase this accuracy down to 30cm
          (https://goo.gl/yhGLv4). Its still not even close to what’s needed,
          but perhaps if this is combined with wifi tracking, accelerometer
          tracking, and visual marker tracking in the real world it might be
          enough. The world is going to look very different with the widespread
          adoption of AR smart glasses. By being aware of what may happen in the
          future, we can start to develop skills to exploit these trends. What
          do you think? Is this a reasonable assumption? Too crazy? Too
          conservative? Too creepy?
